-- Optional policies for S/4 systems can be used for extended system changelog and monitoring but need to be adjusted by the customer before activation. 
-- These have the prefix '_SAPS4_Opt_'. These policies vary with the usage of the SAP HANA database and cannot be defined identical for all HANA systems.

-- technical users where we expect high frequent access should be excluded
-- replace following users with the actual SAPABAP user 
--     Database user <SAPABAP1> (e.g. SAPHANADB)
--     add to the same occurrences other technical users like 
--     SAPABAP1SHD (reduced downtime user for SUM)
--     or any other technical user you expect to execute many operations
--     on a regular base.
-- users must be added comma separated
-- the schema defined by <SAPABAP1>.* must be replaced by the actual DB schema of S4
-- While policies for specific audit actions could also be implemented in the System DB for a Tenant DB
-- by adding "FOR <TENANTDB>" to the create audit policy statement in the System DB
-- to prevent these from changes in the Tenant DB, these
-- policies are meant to be implemented directly in Tenant DB and/or System DB.
 
-- optional: needed for extended system changelog
-- Tenant and System DB
-- if XSC repository is used this policy might cause many entries in the audit log.
-- in a development system we expect this to happen very often so this policy might not be useful
